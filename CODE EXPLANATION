To deal with this problem, I have used the graph data structure where I defined the traveling routes(tickets available) in the code.Then I have given inputs,i.e., start city and end city. There are a some conditions that should be checked, if the start city and end city are the same, ni routes could be provided.If the given start place is not there  in the graph, then there are no routes available. Then, if there is a ticket available from the start city,then we should iterate the start city and end city based on the route provided. This iteration process is done until reaching the end city and the route of the journey is at last printed.
