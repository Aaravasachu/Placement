ASSIGN1_WORD : The Word file used for creating the logo .
ASSIGN1_SNAP: This snapshot is taken from word.
To design the logo attached for the recruitment process of simplifi softech, I have used a basic method ,i.e., Microsoft word. I used basic shapes such as square and rectangles from the insert menu and made alterations according to logo provided. To add the colors, I used the color picker tool to pick the appropriate colors according to the need and filled out the colors. I used the text editor to add wordings to the logo.
